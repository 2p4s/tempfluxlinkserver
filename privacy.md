# Privacy Policy for TempFlux
**Last Updated: February 25, 2026**

TempFlux ("the App") and the TempFluxLink PC companion ("the Service") are designed with a "Local-First" philosophy. We believe your hardware data is your business. This policy explains how we handle information.

---

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
TempFlux does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

* **Hardware Telemetry:** The Service reads system metrics (CPU load, GPU temperature, RAM usage, etc.) from your PC. This data is broadcast strictly over your **local area network (LAN)**.
* **No Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, location data, or unique device identifiers.
* **No Cloud Storage:** None of your hardware telemetry is ever uploaded to a cloud database or shared with third parties.

## 2. Local Network Communication
The App and Service communicate directly with each other over your private home network.
* Users are responsible for ensuring their local network is secure.
* TempFluxLink does not "phone home" or require an internet connection to function once the initial dependencies are met.

## 3. Permissions (Android)
The App may request the following permissions:
* **Network Access:** Required to communicate with the TempFluxLink server on your PC.
* **Wi-Fi State:** Used to verify that the device is connected to the same network as the PC.

## 4. Third-Party Services
TempFlux does not use third-party analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising SDKs. 

## 5. Security
Because all data remains on your local hardware, the security of your data is tied to the security of your local network. We recommend using a password-protected Wi-Fi network and a standard Windows Firewall.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## 7. Contact Us
If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us through the [GitHub Repository Issues](https://github.com/2p4s/tempfluxpclink/issues) page.
